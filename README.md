## Description
The Dice Roller Web App is an interactive tool for rolling various types of dice. This project features a clean design, intuitive controls, and dynamic visuals to simulate different dice rolls. It's perfect for tabletop gamers, D&D enthusiasts, or anyone who needs a quick way to roll dice digitally.

## Features
- **Multiple Dice Options:** Supports common dice types like d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20.
- **Dynamic SVG Graphics:** Interactive visuals for each dice roll.
- **Custom Dice Input:** Roll any custom-sided dice using the input field.
- **Clear Results Button:** Quickly clear previous rolls to start fresh.
- **Interactive Design:** Clickable dice for easy selection and rolling.

## Usage
1. Open the app in any modern browser.
2. Enter the number of dice you want to roll in the first input box.
3. Enter the number of sides (e.g., 6 for a d6) in the second input box.
4. Click the **Roll** button to roll the dice.
5. Alternatively, click on a dice option (e.g., d4, d6) to select it quickly and roll.

## Installation
